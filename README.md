Package to implement Approximate Bayesian computation algorthms. Code currently implements basic ABC rejection sampler and sequential monte carlo algorithm (ABC-SMC) as in Toni. et al 2009. Plans to include ABC-SMC with model selection algorithm from Toni et al 2010.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this you will require the v0.5 of Julia, if you wish to run the example notebook you will need the Jupyter.

```
